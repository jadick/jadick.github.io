I am a MASc student at the [University of Toronto](https://www.ece.utoronto.ca/) working on Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning and Neural Compression. I'm advised by Prof. [Ashish Khisti](https://www.comm.utoronto.ca/~akhisti/).

I hold a B.Sc. in Computer Engineering from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS). During my undergraduate years, I worked on several research projects in academia and industry, addressing Neural Compression, Generative Modeling, Computer Vision, and Integrated Circuits Design.

Before starting my master's at UofT, I worked as a Machine Learning Engineer at the Fashion Tech [Colecao.moda](https://www.colecao.moda/). My work was focused on text-to-image diffusion models.

A more detailed view on my background is available in my [Curriculum Vitae](https://jadick.github.io/files/CV_JoaoDick.pdf).

I'm originally from Porto Alegre, a distant and warmer place in the southmost Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul.
