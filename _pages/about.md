I am a MASc student at the [University of Toronto](https://www.ece.utoronto.ca/) working on AI and Information Theory. I'm advised by Prof. [Ashish Khisti](https://www.comm.utoronto.ca/~akhisti/).

I hold a B.Sc. in Computer Engineering from the [Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul](http://www.ufrgs.br/english/home). During my undergraduate years, I worked on several research projects in academia and industry, addressing neural compression, generative modeling, computer vision, and integrated circuit design.

Before starting my master's at UofT, I worked as a Machine Learning Engineer at the fashion tech [Colecao.moda](https://www.colecao.moda/). My work was focused on text-to-image diffusion models.

I'm originally from [Porto Alegre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porto_Alegre), the capital of the southernmost Brazilian state, Rio Grande do Sul.
